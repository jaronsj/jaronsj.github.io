            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>The name for my weather assignment would be 'Campers Perfect Weather.' I would have a domain of campersperfectweather.com
                and I searched this domain on goDaddy.com to see if it is already taken. I found that the domain would be open to purchase. The
                cost to buy this domain would $1.00 for the first year and then a $1.59 after that.

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website would to be able to help people know the weather when they are planning a camping trip. When people
                go on camping trips they do not want to get stuck in bad weather, so that they are stuck in a tent or cabin. This website 
                would help them in planning their trips so that they know what the weather is like where they camp.

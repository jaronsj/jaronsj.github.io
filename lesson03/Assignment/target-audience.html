        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> The intended target audience for this site is those that are wanting to plan a camping trip. During the summer the weather
            can pretty fast and campers would want to know what kind of items they would need to pack. This website would help them to 
            plan their trips.
        </p>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p> Randy: My name is Randy and I love to be spending time outdoors. The weather plays a big part in what I pack when I want to go 
            camping. It would be useful to have a website that can help me prepare for my trip. I want to be prepared!
        </p>
        <p>
            Kailey: My name is Kailey. I grew up camping and being outdoors. I hate it when my camping trip gets ruined by some bad weather!
            It would be nice to be able to go camping while I am in Idaho. I have noticed that the weather can change several times in a 
            day. A website that can tell me the perfect time to go camping would be great!
        </p>

        <p>A college FHE group want to go for on a cookout in nature and be able to learn more about each other. Being able to tell

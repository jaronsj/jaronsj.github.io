            <h5>Star Valley Wyoming Temple</h5>

            <p>The Star Valley Wyoming Temple was the first temple built in Wyoming.</p>
            <p>
                When problems were encountered with the originally proposed location for the Star Valley Wyoming Temple at the 
                base of Hale Canyon, the location was shifted west next to the highway. The contractor found the ground conditions 
                at the new location to be ideal for the foundation, eliminating the usual need for extensive fill and compaction work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thousands of Church members and friends participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for the Star Valley Wyoming Temple on 
                April 25, 2015. Many more joined by satellite and Internet transmissions. Elder Craig C. Christensen of the Presidency of 
                the Seventy presided. Construction began the following Monday, April 27, 2015.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The placement of the angel Moroni atop the Star Valley Wyoming Temple took place April 25, 2016, exactly one year 
                after the groundbreaking ceremony. The event was announced beforehand, allowing hundreds of spectators to gather 
                and witness the raising.
            </p>
            <p>
                Behind the recommend desk of the Star Valley Wyoming Temple is a stunning stained-glass depiction of Jesus Christ, 
                which is refurbished piece originally created for a Presbyterian Church in New York City.
